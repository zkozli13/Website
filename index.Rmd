## Filtering Rows and Columns 

With SQL, you can filter columns with SELECT and rows with WHERE. Let's look at an example from the Lahman baseball database. First, we need to load some packages. 

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write the following: 

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)

```
